# Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview

This project focuses on applying K-means clustering to perform customer segmentation for a retail store. The main objective is to identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior, which can be utilized for targeted marketing strategies and personalized experiences.

### Key Features
- **Data Analysis:** Analyzed the retail store's customer data to derive meaningful insights.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Implemented K-means clustering, a powerful unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to group customers based on features such as 'Age,' 'Annual Income,' and 'Spending Score.'
- **Optimal Cluster Selection:** Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring accurate segmentation.
- **Visualizations:** Created insightful visualizations, including a dynamic 3D graph, to illustrate customer distribution and cluster characteristics.
- **Evaluation:** Employed the silhouette score to evaluate clustering quality and provide a quantitative measure of segmentation effectiveness.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python). It contains key attributes like `CustomerID`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Annual Income`, and `Spending Score`, which are crucial for understanding customer behavior and implementing effective segmentation.

### Results & Impact
The results demonstrate the power of data-driven decision-making, enabling businesses to strategize, personalize, and optimize customer experiences with enhanced precision.
